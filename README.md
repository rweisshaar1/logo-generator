# Simple Logo Generator

## Purpose:
- I wanted to create a command line application that would create a simple logo for me.

## Instructions for Use:
- Before using the application, one would have to type "npm i" into command line, and download the node_modules package.
- To run the application, type "node index.js" into command line.
- There will be a series of prompts to answer. If an answer if given that is blank or too many characters, it will restart the application for you.
- At the end of the prompts, a logo.svg file will be created.
- Drag the logo.svg file into your browser to see what the logo looks like.
## Starter-Code:
- I was given the code for the circle, which is located in the assests folder.

## Link to GitHub Repo:

## Test:
- I created a test file to test the shape class constructors. To run the test (after the initial npm i), type "npm run test", and it will run the test file.
